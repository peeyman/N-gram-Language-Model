    "Can you guess what the next word would be? if you just guessed it to be **\"been\"**, then you already have an amazing language model built into your brain!\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify'>So, how you were able to guess the next word in the above sentence? The answer is among many words in the language you gave a higher probability to the word **\"been\"** than any other words. And, you did it based on the context, based on the words that already there is the sentence. Actually, the example in the above sentence is an extreme caase. It is hard to think of any word than **\"been\"**. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a less extreme case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is nothing as relaxing as ...**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify'>What are you going to fill in the blank with? There are many words you can think of, right? Like, reading, resting, having, taking, etc. You may think of many other words. Whatever word you are thinking of is because your language model assign a higher probability to them. (Assuming that our brain have a language model in the first place :D !)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify'>So, basically a language model is a model that is able to assign probability to every possible word based on the words already exist in a sentence. This is one definition, another one is language model is a model that is able to assign probability to the entire sentence. Later I will show you how these two definitions are equivalent.\n",
    "The first definition can be cast as conditional probability, i.e probability of next work given the previous words. The second definition can be cast as joint probability, i.e joint probability of all the words in a sentence.</p>"

    "As it is mentioned one definition of a language model is that a language model is a model that is able to assign probability to an entire sentence. Let's consider the following sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "** There is nothing as relaxing as reading a book.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint probability of this sentence can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X_1=\"There\",X_2=\"is\",X_3=\"nothing\",..., X_9=\"book\") $$\n",

    "or more generally for every sentence we want to calculate the following joint probability.\n",

    "$$ P(X_1=w_1,X_2=w_2,X_3=w_3,..., X_n=w_n) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify'>So, in the example sentence above there are 9 words. let's take a moment to think you can we calculate the joint probability of these words. One way of doing this is to count all the occurences of this sentence and also count all the possible sequence of nine words and then divide these two numbers. Or, in other words out of all possible sequence of 9 words, what percentage of them is exactly as the example sentence?  Is this approach practical? We need to calculate possible sequence of different length of sentences. Not only that, for every new sentence we need calculate how many times each sentence occured. It looks like huge amount of computations. Aside from computational complexity, another serious issue is that because language is so creative, many new sentences can be generated than never happened in our dataset. The problem is that just because they haven't occurred before we cannot simply assign probability of zero to them.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify'>Due to the mentioned reasons there is a need for more intelligent way to calculate the probability of sentences. One clever way is to use **chain rule of probability** which is as follows.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X_1,X_2,...,X_n) = P(X_1)\\:P(X_2|X_1)\\:P(X_3|X_1,X_2)...P(X_n|X_1,X_2,...X_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify'>This rule turn joint probability into conditional probability. Which loosely speaking allows us to break the joint probability of all words in the sequence into smaller parts. Breaking things into smaller parts is a general approach of problem solving. Isn't it?</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more concrete let's take the first there of our example sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is nothing**\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify'>It seems great! Now we can calculate each term in the right side of the equation separately. For example to calculate the $ P(X_1=\"There\") $, we can count how many time the word \"**There**\" occured in our dataset and divide it by all possible occurrences of one words which is equivalent to the length of our corpus(dataset). Or to calculate $ P(X_3=\"nothing\"|X_1=\"There\",X_2=\"is\") $, we need to calculate how many time the word \"**nothing**\" occured after the two word combination of \"**There is**\" and then divide it by number of time \"**There is**\" happened in our dataset. It is clear to see that after \"**There is**\" many other words other than \"**nothing**\" can occur.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that for the sake of notation simplicity Xs are not written. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align:justify'>What do we need to do to calculate this probability. The same as above we need to count number of time the sequence \"**There is nothing as relaxing as reading a**\" is occurred. Also number of the times that \"**book**\" appeared after \"**There is nothing as relaxing as reading a**\". But, isn't it the same problem as we we have in the joint probability calculation. Remember again that language is creative and the chance that a sequence of specific words happens can be zero or even if it is not zero due to the rare occurrence it might not capture the true probability.</p>\n",
